# JohnOrtizAp-Compsci-REAL
Projects
All of these projects are from my computer science course from highschool, this was how they wanted it structered(I know it does not look the best structurally...)This probably one of the worst places to look if you want to see how I code today but the best place in this repository would be below:
JohnOrtizAp-Compsci-REAL/LabAssesmentmarch2/src/LabAssesment.java 

Note that every other portion of this repository had alot of base structures while using my code to complete the assignment. The lab assesment above was strictly my code.
